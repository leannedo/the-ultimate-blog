# Keep coming back and improve it!

When I first start learning coding, I still had the habit of an ordinary student who finishes her exercises and leave them aside, continuing with next exercises, and the next, and the next. 
It was very rare that I took time to come back to my old coding exercises and thought about ways to improve them. It seemed to me that the process of coming back to previous works was something really
burdensome and, I've got to say, boring. 

It's usually at this point that I would say "and there something happened that changed my mind", but honestly I have no kind of story like that. I don't know when and how I start to realize that 
coming back to my old code is something necessary because it helped me understand my lessons even more, and I helped me figure out new ways to improve my code. 
For example if I just knew how to write a while..loop that cost me a few lines in my while...loop lesson, I later know how to implement the loop with the for loop, which only accumulate 1 line of code for 
the same result. 

I simply just told myself that that's a part of a developer's job because as a developer, you have to develop, and not developing in the sense of building new things, but develop from the old and weak
foundation and transform that ugly project into something novel and modern. Of course it's lie to say that "Oh I'm so exicited to improve my work, I open the same project everyday and feel energetic by it".
I still say to myself "eww it's boring, I hate it, I want to solve new problems", but I've learnt from my husband that in a tech company sometimes you have to work on the same project for a couple of months, or
years, and I know that if I keep negative vibes about "already-solved" projects I wouldn't do me any good. 

I've learnt that having a solution to a problem is not a difficult task, but finding a roburst and
