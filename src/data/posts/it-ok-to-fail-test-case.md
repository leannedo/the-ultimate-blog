## As long as you've tried your best

At first when my Java lessons was still simple, straightforward and consisted of all easy exercises, I felt overwhelmingly satisfied with myself whenever I returned a solution to the TMC server and received the announcement that my solution had passed all test cases. The green marks on my screen and the statement "All tests passed on the server" filled me with pride and content, the naive feeling of a child when it successfully solves the very first math problem in its entire life "1 plus 1 equals 2". 

That naive feeling would gradually be replaced by a sour feeling of failing as the lessons and the exercises get harder and harder. Of course I do not expect that I would do it right every single time, yet failing is the bitter medicine to swallow. And I wouldn't have felt so embarassed and angry to myself if the errors had not been for my carelessness: sometimes they were caused by the lack of a semicolon, which could have been avoided if I had checked my code one last time before submitting, sometimes they were caused by the lack of...well...brain, and sometimes errors were the mystery of time which I did not know where it came from and how to get it fixed.  

Yet looking on the bright side, each failing leads me to a different land of knowledge which fruits will then be added to my basket of experience. Such as I know that if I want to have a value added up with the amount stated by users, I should declare it and assign it to 0 outside of the while loop instead of inside because everytime the while loop executes the value will be set to 0 again. 

```
int value = 0;
while (true) {
    System.out.print("Add to the value: ");
    int amount = Integer.valueOf(scan.nextLine());

    if (amount > 0) {
        value += amount;
    }
......
```

I've learnt to be patient when trying to untangle errors because sometimes things are not as straightforward as it seems, and it requires a bit of effort to research, Google searches, or ask JJ. More importantly, I've learnt that there are cases when my solution is more suffice, but it's not what the requirements are asking for, and that's why it failed. Similar to the workplace, as JJ once told me, sometimes you come up with a brilliant solution, but it can be rejected because the client didn't like it. It's just normal, as I soon understand.

Now after a few months into this, I've got used to the fact that errors are part of a developer's work and failing test cases are part of a developer's experience because a developer develops, and if everything is perfect, what to do next? The more errors they meet with, the sharper their problem solving skills become. 

### Sum it upppp!

It's OK to fail test cases. Yet, I do not allow myself to be careless and hasty as to make avoidable mistakes such as mistyping variable names or missing semicolons, etc. I try to overcome my feeling of "OK I'm done now let's get it checked on the server" and instead say "Calm down let's check it YOURSELF FIRST and see if there is anything overlooked". I'm fully awared that I'm not receiving an adequate education in this field like a lot of other people, so I always try my best in everything I do to make up for that. 

I hope that you could be as well resilient and persistent to achieve what you're aiming for. See you in the next post!

### Bye friends.
