Helsinki _ 25.02.2020 _ AfterNoon

A sunny day at 0.

Moving to the next problem of printing a tabular table consisting of 5 lines. Each line starts with a number, followed by the tenth of the number, followed by its hundredth and its thousandth.

With this problem I used the for loop with int i starting from 1 and counting to 5, incremented by 1 each time. 

Everytime the loop runs, the program prints i, i*10, i*100, and i*1000 on one line, separated by spaces, and at the end of the line, there's a break.

Keep continue like that till the end of the loop, when i equals to 5.
